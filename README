OVERVIEW
========

The udisks project provides a daemon, tools and libraries to access
and manipulate disks and storage devices.

The intended audience of udisks include higher-level layers of the
operating system, for example the desktop shell (e.g. GNOME) and disk
management applications (e.g. GNOME Disks).

If you are writing an application and do not want to tie yourself to a
specific version of the operating system, you should not use udisks
but instead use either

 - Low-level guaranteed-stable APIs such as e.g. sysfs, libudev,
   libmount, /proc/self/mountinfo, mount(8)/umount(8) commands

 - High-level guaranteed-stable APIs such as e.g. GVolumeMonitor,
   see http://developer.gnome.org/gio/unstable/volume_mon.html

LICENSE
=======

See the COPYING file for the license. In a nutshell, the daemon and
tools are licensed under the GPLv2 (or later) and libraries are
licensed under LGPLv2 (or later).
