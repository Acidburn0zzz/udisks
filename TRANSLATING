LOCALIZATION
============

UDisks localization is done in the Zanata translation platform.
UDisks project is located here:

  https://fedora.zanata.org/project/view/udisks

You need a Fedora account (FAS) to login, if you don't have one, you can create
it here:

  https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/

Documentation for translators on Zanata:

  http://docs.zanata.org/en/latest/user-guide/translator-guide/

PO files in this repository (directory "po") are downloaded from Zanata for
every release just for archive generation and as a backup. Please don't open
pull requests or send patches with new translations here. We can't manually
upload translation files to Zanata and deal with conflicts in languages we
don't speak.
