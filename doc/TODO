- TODO List
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - D-Bus interface optimizations
   - problem: right now a lot of round-tripping is needed
   - solution: for Foo=Device,Adapter,Expander,Port
     - EnumerateFoo() should return a(oa{sv}) instead of just 'ao'
       where the a{sv} contains the properties
     - FooAdded() should be 'oa{sv}' instead of just 'o'
       where the a{sv} contains all properties
     - FooChanged() should be 'oa{sv}' instead of just 'o'
       where the a{sv} contains the properties that has
       changed
   - this will break the D-Bus interface so we we need to bump the
     minor number (e.g. 1.0.x -> 1.1.0 transition)

 - We should probably use "Phy" instead of "Port"
   - do this when breaking the D-Bus interface for other reasons

 - When the GDBus stuff lands in GLib we should probably start using it

 - We probably have too many polkit actions - probably just two are enough
   - reads should require org.fd.udisks.read
     - this should be yes
   - write/modification should require org.fd.udisks.write
     - this should be auth_admin_keep

 - It would be nice to be able to have different back-ends

 - The D-BUS API is supposed to be synchronous, but property updates are racy
   in many cases (tests/run --no-workarounds exposes those). These should get
   fixed by having the methods only return after the properties that were
   affected by the call got updated.

- Future features
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - iSCSI
   - initiator (connect to drive)
   - target (share drive)
   - see notes in doc/TODO-ISCSI

 - Filesystem check
   - how can we do interactive fsck? Connect to a socket on the
     client and then make the client includes a terminal emulator?
     Yuck

 - Partition/Filesystem resizing
   - Maybe just enhance PartitionModify
