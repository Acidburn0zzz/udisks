------------------------------------------------------------------------
- TODO List
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before (next) release:

 - SMART
   - Need a way to stop polling for SMART data to avoid
     breaking boxes with thousands of disks
     - maybe default to polling if there's less than, say, 50 drives
   - Delete all SMART data older than N days
     - polling every 30 min is roughly 50kb / drive / day
   - Probably needs config file for this

 - Poll storage devices

 - Use new cdrom_id attrs from udev

 - Need to figure out what PolicyKit authorizations to use
   - it's really a big mess right now

 - Split out Linux specific bits into separate files

 - General cleanup + documentation
   - devkit-disk-device.c is way too long right now

 - Finish up Linux MD Software RAID support
   - Major thing missing right now is creating an array

 - Finish D-Bus documentation framework
   - and have Jon McCann review it (it's based on his work from
     ConsoleKit)

 - General project management tasks
   - review licenses, NEWS, TODO, HACKING etc. file

------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Current features (TODO: this section is incomplete)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Enumerate and manipulate block devices including;
   - Filesystems / Signatures
     - create, modify label, delete, mount, unmount
   - Partitions and Partition Tables
     - create, modify, delete
   - Linux MD Software RAID (both arrays and components)
     - add/remove components, start, stop
   - LUKS devices
     - create, change passphrase
   - Change notifications

 - Retrieve SMART data
   - includes storing a history in a database

------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Future features (TODO: this section is incomplete)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Share drives via iSCSI
   - initiator (connect to drive)
   - target (offer drive)

 - Filesystem check
   - non-interactive is easy
   - how can we do interactive fsck? Connect to a socket on the
     client and the client includes a terminal emulator? Yuck

 - Partition/Filesystem resizing
   - Maybe just enhance PartitionModify

 - Support for recognizing LVM2 PV's and LV's

 - Support for recognizing partitioned disks setup via e.g. kpartx

 - Support for non-Linux
