    <!-- BEGIN LIST OF METHODS -->


    <!-- BEGIN LIST OF SIGNALS -->


    <!-- BEGIN LIST OF PROPERTIES

         A general note about properties: the set of valus returned
         can be expected to grow in the future as hardware evolves.
         Care has been taken to both namespace some values (so
         applications can make educated guesses) and export both
         general and specific properties (such as id_usage
         vs. id_type). In general an empty property means "not set" -->

    <!-- the OS native path; on Linux this is the sysfs path -->
    <property name="native-path" type="s" access="read"/>

    <!-- block special device file for access the device -->
    <property name="device-file" type="s" access="read"/>

    <!-- if set, a (unique) stable path to the device in question -->
    <property name="device-file-by-id" type="s" access="read"/>

    <!-- if set, a stable path to the port the device is connected to -->
    <property name="device-file-by-path" type="s" access="read"/>

    <!-- the usage is a result of probing for signatures on the block
         device; known values are

           filesystem      - the device contains a file system
           crypto          - the device contains encrypted data
           partitiontable  - the device is partitioned into other devices
           raid            - the device is member of a RAID set or another
                             scheme that requires device assembly
           other           - other signature found on the device -->
    <property name="id-usage" type="s" access="read"/>

    <!-- More detailed result of signature probing. The value depends
         on the value of 'id-usage'

           filesystem      - the filesystem type e.g. vfat, ext3 and so forth
           crypto          - the crypto type; only known value is crypto_LUKS
           partitiontable  - the partition table type; known values
                              mbr  - Master Boot Record
                              embr - Extended Master Boot Record

                              gpt  - GUID Partition Table
           raid            - the type of raid (TODO)
           other           - known types are: swap -->
    <property name="id-type" type="s" access="read"/>

    <!-- If set, the version of the format specified by 'id-type' -->
    <property name="id-version" type="s" access="read"/>

    <!-- If set, an UUID for the format specified by 'id-type' -->
    <property name="id-uuid" type="s" access="read"/>

    <!-- If set, a label for the format specified by 'id-type' -->
    <property name="id-label" type="s" access="read"/>

    <!-- these properties are only set if the enclosing drive of the
         device could be identified; drive-media-compatibility is a
         whitespace separated list of media types; known media types
         are

           floppy
           floppy_zip
           floppy_jaz

         The drive-media-type property will only contain one of these
         types. Known values for the drive-connection-type are

           ata

           firewire

         The property drive-connection-version may not be set.
