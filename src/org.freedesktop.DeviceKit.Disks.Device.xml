    <!-- BEGIN LIST OF METHODS -->


    <!-- BEGIN LIST OF SIGNALS -->


    <!-- BEGIN LIST OF PROPERTIES

         A general note about properties: the set of values returned
         can be expected to grow in the future as hardware evolves.
         Care has been taken to both namespace some values (so
         applications can make educated guesses) and export both
         general and specific properties (such as id_usage
         vs. id_type). In general an empty property means "not set" -->

    <!-- the OS native path; on Linux this is the sysfs path -->
    <property name="native-path" type="s" access="read"/>

    <!-- block special device file for access the device -->
    <property name="device-file" type="s" access="read"/>

    <!-- array of stable paths to the device file in question -->
    <property name="device-file-by-id" type="as" access="read"/>

    <!-- array of stable paths to the port the device is connected to -->
    <property name="device-file-by-path" type="as" access="read"/>

    <!-- true if the device is a partition -->
    <property name="device-is-partition" type="b" access="read"/>

    <!-- true if the device contains a partition table -->
    <property name="device-is-partition-table" type="b" access="read"/>

    <!-- true if an enclosing drive for the device could be identified -->
    <property name="device-has-drive" type="b" access="read"/>

    <!-- the usage is a result of probing for signatures on the block
         device; known values are

           filesystem      - the device contains a file system
           crypto          - the device contains encrypted data
           partitiontable  - the device is partitioned into other devices
           raid            - the device is member of a RAID set or another
                             scheme that requires device assembly
           other           - other signature found on the device -->
    <property name="id-usage" type="s" access="read"/>

    <!-- more detailed result of signature probing. The value depends
         on the value of 'id-usage'

           filesystem      - the filesystem type e.g. vfat, ext3 and so forth
           crypto          - the crypto type; only known value is crypto_LUKS
           partitiontable  - the partition table type; known values
                              mbr  - Master Boot Record
                              embr - Extended Master Boot Record
                              apm  - Apple Partitoning Map
                              gpt  - GUID Partition Table
           raid            - the type of raid (TODO)
           other           - known types are: swap -->
    <property name="id-type" type="s" access="read"/>

    <!-- the version of the format specified by 'id-type' -->
    <property name="id-version" type="s" access="read"/>

    <!-- an UUID for the format specified by 'id-type' -->
    <property name="id-uuid" type="s" access="read"/>

    <!-- a label for the format specified by 'id-type' -->
    <property name="id-label" type="s" access="read"/>

    <!-- the following properties are only set if the device is
         a partition (see 'device-is-partition'). Known values
         for the partitioning scheme are

           mbr  - Master Boot Record
           embr - Extended Master Boot Record
           apm  - Apple Partitoning Map
           gpt  - GUID Partition Table

         The 'partition-slave' property specifies what device
         the device in question is a partition of. The property
         'partition-number' is the number of the partition starting
         from 1 -->
    <property name="partition-slave" type="s" access="read"/>
    <property name="partition-scheme" type="s" access="read"/>
    <property name="partition-type" type="s" access="read"/>
    <property name="partition-label" type="s" access="read"/>
    <property name="partition-uuid" type="s" access="read"/>
    <property name="partition-flags" type="as" access="read"/>
    <property name="partition-number" type="i" access="read"/>
    <property name="partition-offset" type="t" access="read"/>
    <property name="partition-size" type="t" access="read"/>

    <!-- the type of partition table the deice contains; only set if
         'device-is-partition-table' is true. Known values are

           mbr  - Master Boot Record
           embr - Extended Master Boot Record
           apm  - Apple Partitoning Map
           gpt  - GUID Partition Table

         The 'partition-table-count' property specifies the number
         of partitions in the partition table. Note that the
         partitions may not be sequentially numbered (e.g.
         it's fine for 'partition-table-count' to report 2
         and 'partition-number' for the associated paritions
         report 1 resp. 4).

    <property name="drive-removable-media-available" type="b" access="read"/>
